                 the capability to exploit the whole body to perform tasks.
                 This work introduces a novel whole body control library called
                 OpenSoT. OpenSoT is combined with joint impedance control to
                 create a framework that can effectively generate complex whole
                 body motion behaviors for humanoids according to the needs of
                 the interaction level of the tasks. OpenSoT gives an easy way
                 to implement tasks, constraints, bounds and solvers by
                 providing common interfaces. We present the mathematical
                 foundation of the library and validate it on the compliant
                 humanoid robot COMAN to execute multiple motion tasks under a
                 number of constraints. The framework is able to solve
                 hierarchies of tasks of arbitrary complexity in a robust and
                 reliable way.",

                 performance for our compliant humanoid robot (COMAN), in this
                 paper we propose a semi-autonomous control framework and
                 evaluate it experimentally in a valve turning setup. The
                 control structure consists of various modules and interfaces
                 to identify the valve, locate the robot in front of it and
                 perform the manipulation. The manipulation module implements
                 four motion primitives (Reach, Grasp, Rotate and Disengage)
                 and realizes the corresponding desired impedance profile for
                 each phase to accomplish the task. In this direction, to
                 establish a stable and compliant contact between the valve and
                 the robot hands, while being able to generate the sufficient
                 rotational torques depending on the valve's friction, Rotate
                 incorporates a novel dual-arm impedance control technique to
                 plan and realize a task-appropriate impedance profile. Results
                 of the implementation of the proposed control framework are
                 firstly evaluated in simulation studies using Gazebo.
                 Subsequent experimental results highlight the efficiency of
                 the proposed impedance planning and control in generation of
                 the required interaction forces to accomplish the task.",

               consists of two 4-DOF non-planar VSA manipulators, for a
               peg-in-hole assembly task using both arms. One arm holds the peg
               and the other holds the hole. The task is accomplished without
               any force measurement and without calling for
               parallel-manipulator control techniques, exploiting the
               intrinsic mechanical elasticity of the actuator units. Indeed, a
               simple position control scheme is required. Simulations and
               experimental results are reported.",
