               kinematic and algorithmic type, may affect the correct hierarchy
               in task execution. Existing methods deal with singularities

              Each motion-tracking task is associated with a task wrench.
              Bounds are imposed on lower priority task wrenches to ensure the
              controller performance of higher priority tasks. An optimization

              that it can handle inequality constraints on a higher priority

               physical interaction between the robot and the environment, or a
               human, is contemplated. iTaSC, in its original formulation,
               allows for a systematic derivation of control schemes from task
               descriptions; tasks are defined as constraints enforced on
               outputs (e.g. distances, angles), and the iTaSC control takes
               care to fulfil such constraints by computing desired velocities
               to be commanded to the robot(s) joints. This approach, being
               based on a velocity resolution scheme, principally addresses
               tasks where positioning is the main issue. However, tasks that
               involve contacts with the environment or with the user, either
               desired or accidental, can be considered as well, taking
               advantage of impedance control, when position is controlled, or

               This result is achieved by taking advantage of an approximate

               task specification using constraints) toward manipulation tasks.
               iTaSC offers two advantages with respect to other methods: the
               ability to specify tasks in different spaces (and not only in
               Cartesian coordinates as for the Task Frame Formalism), and the
               treatment of geometric uncertainties. These properties may be
               very useful within a manipulation context, where tasks are
               executed by robots with many degrees of freedom, which calls for
               some degree of abstraction; by choosing a suitable set of
               coordinates, it is possible to reduce the complexity and the
               number of constraints that fully describe such tasks; in
               addition, controlling only the subspace that is needed to fulfil
               a task allows us to use the remaining degrees of freedom of the
               robot system to achieve secondary objectives. This paper
               discusses the instruments and techniques that can be employed in
               manipulation scenarios; in particular it focuses on aspects like
               the specification of a grasp and control of the stance of the
               robotic arm. iTaSC offers the possibility of specifying a grasp.
               While this approach allows for very fine control of a grasping
               task, in most cases a less fine-grain specification suffices to
               guarantee a successful execution of the grasping action. To this
               end synergy-based grasp specification is formulated within
               iTaSC. We also show how to take into account secondary
               objectives for the arm stance. In particular we consider, as an
               example, the manipulability index along a given direction. Such
               indexes are maximised by exploring the null space of the other
               tasks. The proposed approach is demonstrated by means of
               simulations, where a robotic hand grasps a cylindrical object.",

              both instantaneous task specification and estimation of geometric
              uncertainty in a unified framework. Major components are the use
              of feature coordinates, defined with respect to object and

              introduction of uncertainty coordinates to model geometric

               conventionally faces the choice between a complex, full-body
               dynamic model containing every link and actuator of the robot,
               or a highly simplified model of the robot as a point mass. In
               this paper we explore a powerful middle ground between these
               extremes. We exploit the fact that while the full dynamics of
               humanoid robots are complicated, their centroidal dynamics (the
               evolution of the angular momentum and the center of mass (COM)
               position) are much simpler. By treating the dynamics of the
               robot in centroidal form and directly optimizing the joint
               trajectories for the actuated degrees of freedom, we arrive at a
               method that enjoys simpler dynamics, while still having the
               expressiveness required to handle kinematic constraints such as
               collision avoidance or reaching to a target. We further require
               that the robot's COM and angular momentum as computed from the
               joint trajectories match those given by the centroidal dynamics.
               This ensures that the dynamics considered by our optimization
               are equivalent to the full dynamics of the robot, provided that
               the robot's actuators can supply sufficient torque. We
               demonstrate that this algorithm is capable of generating
               highly-dynamic motion plans with examples of a humanoid robot
               negotiating obstacle course elements and gait optimization for a
               quadrupedal robot. Additionally, we show that we can plan

               degrees of freedom of a robot during the execution of a task. In
               this paper, a new solution is proposed. The key idea is to
               divide the global full-constraining task into several subtasks,
               which can be applied or inactivated to take into account
               potential constraints of the environment. Far from any
               constraint, the robot moves according to the full task. When it
               comes closer to a configuration to avoid, a higher level
               controller removes one or several subtasks, and activates them
               again when the constraint is avoided. The last controller
               ensures the convergence at the global level by introducing some
               look-ahead capabilities when a local minimum is reached. The
               robot accomplishes the global task by automatically sequencing
