		  respect to other methods: the ability to specify tasks in
		  different spaces (and not only in Cartesian coordinates as
		  for the Task Frame Formalism), and the treatment of
		  geometric uncertainties. These properties may be very
		  useful within a manipulation context, where tasks are
		  executed by robots with many degrees of freedom, which
		  calls for some degree of abstraction; by choosing a
		  suitable set of coordinates, it is possible to reduce the
		  complexity and the number of constraints that fully

		  subspace that is needed to fulfil a task allows us to use
		  the remaining degrees of freedom of the robot system to
		  achieve secondary objectives. This paper discusses the
		  instruments and techniques that can be employed in
		  manipulation scenarios; in particular it focuses on aspects
		  like the specification of a grasp and control of the stance
		  of the robotic arm. iTaSC offers the possibility of
		  specifying a grasp. While this approach allows for very
		  fine control of a grasping task, in most cases a less

		  are maximised by exploring the null space of the other
		  tasks. The proposed approach is demonstrated by means of

		  conventionally faces the choice between a complex,
		  full-body dynamic model containing every link and actuator
		  of the robot, or a highly simplified model of the robot as
		  a point mass. In this paper we explore a powerful middle
		  ground between these extremes. We exploit the fact that
		  while the full dynamics of humanoid robots are complicated,
		  their centroidal dynamics (the evolution of the angular
		  momentum and the center of mass (COM) position) are much
		  simpler. By treating the dynamics of the robot in
		  centroidal form and directly optimizing the joint
		  trajectories for the actuated degrees of freedom, we arrive
		  at a method that enjoys simpler dynamics, while still
		  having the expressiveness required to handle kinematic
		  constraints such as collision avoidance or reaching to a
		  target. We further require that the robot's COM and angular
		  momentum as computed from the joint trajectories match
		  those given by the centroidal dynamics. This ensures that
		  the dynamics considered by our optimization are equivalent
		  to the full dynamics of the robot, provided that the
		  robot's actuators can supply sufficient torque. We
		  demonstrate that this algorithm is capable of generating
		  highly-dynamic motion plans with examples of a humanoid

		  optimization for a quadrupedal robot. Additionally, we show
		  that we can plan without pre-specifying the contact

		  solve QP problems are parametric active-set methods that
		  are based on tracing the solution along a linear homotopy
		  between a QP problem with known solution and the QP problem
		  to be solved. This approach seems to make them particularly
		  suited for applications where a-priori information can be

		  accuracy is required. In this paper we describe the
		  open-source C++ software package {\tt qpOASES}, which
		  implements a parametric active-set method in a reliable and
		  efficient way. Numerical tests show that {\tt qpOASES} can
		  outperform other popular academic and commercial QP solvers
		  on small- to medium-scale convex test examples of the
		  Maros-M\'esz\'aros QP collection. Moreover, various
		  interfaces to third-party software packages make it easy to

		  principles of the Task Frame and instantaneous Task
		  Specification using Constraints (iTaSC) formalisms. iTaSC
		  is found particularly suitable due to its ability to
		  express and combine control tasks in a natural way. Control
		  tasks can be formulated as combinations of target
		  positions, velocities, or forces expressed in an arbitrary
		  number and type of coordinate frames. The proposed
		  framework is applied to a mixed mechatronic system composed
		  of a traditional rigid-link robot whose end-effector is a
		  continuum (flexible) link. A selection of different
		  position/force control tasks is prepared to demonstrate the
		  validity and general nature of the proposed framework.",
