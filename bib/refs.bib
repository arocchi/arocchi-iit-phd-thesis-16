It avoids some of the common pitfalls in previous frameworks, and provides a flexible and composable way to define robot control tasks. An architecture for a robot controller is proposed, as well as an implementation that can execute tasks described in the new specification language. Typical usage patterns for the new framework are explained on an example consisting of a kinematically redundant, bi-manual task on a PR2 robot.

  Abstract                 = {With the purpose of achieving a desired interaction performance for our compliant humanoid robot (COMAN), in this paper we propose a semi-autonomous control framework and evaluate it experimentally in a valve turning setup. The control structure consists of various modules and interfaces to identify the valve, locate the robot in front of it and perform the manipulation. The manipulation module implements four motion primitives (Reach, Grasp, Rotate and Disengage) and realizes the corresponding desired impedance profile for each phase to accomplish the task. In this direction, to establish a stable and compliant contact between the valve and the robot hands, while being able to generate the sufficient rotational torques depending on the valve's friction, Rotate incorporates a novel dual-arm impedance control technique to plan and realize a task-appropriate impedance profile. Results of the implementation of the proposed control framework are firstly evaluated in simulation studies using Gazebo. Subsequent experimental results highlight the efficiency of the proposed impedance planning and control in generation of the required interaction forces to accomplish the task.},

Indeed, a simple position control scheme is required. Simulations and experimental results are reported.},

To really exploit the potential of robots in these scenarios, it should be possible to enforce force and geometrical constraints in an easy and flexible way. iTaSC allows to express such constraints in different frames expressed in arbitrary spaces and to obtain control setpoints in a systematic way. In previous implementations of iTaSC, industrial velocity-controlled robots were considered. This work presents an extension of the iTaSC-framework that allows to take advantage of the back-drivability of a robot thus avoiding the use of force sensors. Then, as a casestudy, the iTaSC-framework is used to formulate a (positionposition) teleoperation scheme. The theoretical findings are experimentally validated using a PR2 robot.},

  Abstract                 = {This work aims to extend the application field of the constraint-based control framework called iTaSC (instantaneous task specification using constraints) toward manipulation tasks. iTaSC offers two advantages with respect to other methods: the ability to specify tasks in different spaces (and not only in Cartesian coordinates as for the Task Frame Formalism), and the treatment of geometric uncertainties. These properties may be very useful within a manipulation context, where tasks are executed by robots with many degrees of freedom, which calls for some degree of abstraction; by choosing a suitable set of coordinates, it is possible to reduce the complexity and the number of constraints that fully describe such tasks; in addition, controlling only the subspace that is needed to fulfil a task allows us to use the remaining degrees of freedom of the robot system to achieve secondary objectives. This paper discusses the instruments and techniques that can be employed in manipulation scenarios; in particular it focuses on aspects like the specification of a grasp and control of the stance of the robotic arm. iTaSC offers the possibility of specifying a grasp. While this approach allows for very fine control of a grasping task, in most cases a less fine-grain specification suffices to guarantee a successful execution of the grasping action. To this end synergy-based grasp specification is formulated within iTaSC. We also show how to take into account secondary objectives for the arm stance. In particular we consider, as an example, the manipulability index along a given direction. Such indexes are maximised by exploring the null space of the other tasks. The proposed approach is demonstrated by means of simulations, where a robotic hand grasps a cylindrical object.},

  Abstract                 = {This work aims to extend the application field of the constraint-based control framework called iTaSC (instantaneous task specification using constraints) toward tasks where physical interaction between the robot and the environment, or a human, is contemplated. iTaSC, in its original formulation, allows for a systematic derivation of control schemes from task descriptions; tasks are defined as constraints enforced on outputs (e.g. distances, angles), and the iTaSC control takes care to fulfil such constraints by computing desired velocities to be commanded to the robot(s) joints. This approach, being based on a velocity resolution scheme, principally addresses tasks where positioning is the main issue. However, tasks that involve contacts with the environment or with the user, either desired or accidental, can be considered as well, taking advantage of impedance control, when position is controlled, or with force control. This paper describes the implementation of force tasks, and, by the combination of conflicting force and position tasks, impedance control, within the iTaSC formalism. This result is achieved by taking advantage of an approximate physical modelling of the robotic system and the environment. The proposed control scheme is tested by means of experiments where constraints on forces and/or positions described in cylindrical coordinates are imposed on a Kuka LWR arm.},

  abstract =      {Developing robot agnostic software frameworks involves synthesizing the disparate fields of robotic theory and software engineering while simultaneously accounting for a large variability in hardware designs and control paradigms. As the capabilities of robotic software frameworks increase, the setup difficulty and learning curve for new users also increase. If the entry barriers for configuring and using the software on robots is too high, even the most powerful of frameworks are useless. A growing need exists in robotic software engineering to aid users in getting started with, and customizing, the software framework as necessary for particular robotic applications. In this paper a case study is presented for the best practices found for lowering the barrier of entry in the MoveIt! framework, an open-source tool for mobile manipulation in ROS, that allows users to 1) quickly get basic motion planning functionality with minimal initial setup, 2) automate its configuration and optimization, and 3) easily customize its components. A graphical interface that assists the user in configuring MoveIt! is the cornerstone of our approach, coupled with the use of an existing standardized robot model for input, automatically generated robot-specific configuration files, and a plugin-based architecture for extensibility. These best practices are summarized into a set of barrier to entry design principles applicable to other robotic software. The approaches for lowering the entry barrier are evaluated by usage statistics, a user survey, and compared against our design objectives for their effectiveness to users.},

  Abstract                 = {To plan dynamic, whole-body motions for robots, one conventionally faces the choice between a complex, full-body dynamic model containing every link and actuator of the robot, or a highly simplified model of the robot as a point mass. In this paper we explore a powerful middle ground between these extremes. We exploit the fact that while the full dynamics of humanoid robots are complicated, their centroidal dynamics (the evolution of the angular momentum and the center of mass (COM) position) are much simpler. By treating the dynamics of the robot in centroidal form and directly optimizing the joint trajectories for the actuated degrees of freedom, we arrive at a method that enjoys simpler dynamics, while still having the expressiveness required to handle kinematic constraints such as collision avoidance or reaching to a target. We further require that the robot's COM and angular momentum as computed from the joint trajectories match those given by the centroidal dynamics. This ensures that the dynamics considered by our optimization are equivalent to the full dynamics of the robot, provided that the robot's actuators can supply sufficient torque. We demonstrate that this algorithm is capable of generating highly-dynamic motion plans with examples of a humanoid robot negotiating obstacle course elements and gait optimization for a quadrupedal robot. Additionally, we show that we can plan without pre-specifying the contact sequence by exploiting the complementarity conditions between contact forces and contact distance.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper introduces a systematic constraint-based approach to specify complex tasks of general sensor-based robot systems consisting of rigid links and joints. The approach integrates both instantaneous task specification and estimation of geometric uncertainty in a unified framework. Major components are the use of feature coordinates, defined with respect to object and feature frames, which facilitate the task specification, and the introduction of uncertainty coordinates to model geometric uncertainty. While the focus of the paper is on task specification, an existing velocity- based control scheme is reformulated in terms of these feature and uncertainty coordinates. This control scheme compensates for the effect of time varying uncertainty coordinates. Constraint weighting results in an invariant robot behavior in case of conflicting constraints with heterogeneous units. The approach applies to a large variety of robot systems (mobile robots, multiple robot systems, dynamic human-robot interaction, etc.), various sensor systems, and different robot tasks. Ample simulation and experimental results are presented.}

These extensions are made while retaining a tractable mathematical problem structure (a convex program). Furthermore, first results on extending the approach to non-instantaneous tasks are presented.

In our previous work, we presented (i) a generic modeling approach for geometrically complex robot tasks, including the modeling of parametric uncertainty, in order to allow the robot task programmer to specify the optimization problem without explicitly writing down the different (possibly numerous and involved) constraint equations, and (ii) methods for solving these optimization problem online in the instantaneous case (reactive control), and offline in the non-instantaneous case (trajectory planning). This paper has two contributions. First, it extends our framework to include task constraints (e.g. tracking a curve) that are not given as explicit functions of time. These constraints are highly relevant in practice, for example to facilitate time-optimal path planning combined with other constraints.

This paper presents a literature survey and attribute-based bibliography of the current state of the art in robotic middleware design. The main aim of the survey is to assist robotic middleware researchers in evaluating the strengths and weaknesses of current approaches and their appropriateness for their applications.

When processing all tasks in their priority order, a correct preemptive strategy is realized in this way, i.e., a task of higher priority uses in the best way the feasible robot capabilities it needs, while lower priority tasks are accommodated with the residual capability and do not interfere with the execution of higher priority tasks. The algorithm automatically integrates a multi-task least possible scaling strategy, when some ordered set of original tasks is found to be unfeasible.

The proposed SNS (Saturation in the Null Space) iterative algorithm proceeds by successively discarding the use of joints that would exceed their motion bounds when using the minimum norm solution and reintroducing them at a saturated level by means of a projection in a suitable null space. The method is first defined at the velocity level and then moved to the acceleration level, so as to avoid joint velocity discontinuities due to the switching of saturated joints. Moreover, the algorithm includes an optimal task scaling in case the desired task trajectory is unfeasible under the given joint bounds. We also propose the integration of obstacle avoidance in the Cartesian space by properly modifying on line the joint bounds. Simulation and experimental results reported for the 7-dof lightweight KUKA LWR IV robot illustrate the properties and computational efficiency of the method.},

Although there are extensive studies on the algorithms and theory behind WBOSC, limited studies exist on the software architecture and APIs that enable WBOSC to perform and be integrated into a larger system. In this paper, we address this by presenting ControlIt!, a new open-source software framework for WBOSC. Unlike previous implementations, ControlIt! is multi-threaded to increase maximum servo frequencies using standard PC hardware. A new parameter binding mechanism enables tight integration between ControlIt! and external processes via an extensible set of transport protocols.

The first stage generates a twice-differentiable interpolating path that obeys kinematic contact constraints up to a user-specified tolerance. The second stage optimizes speeds along the path to minimize time while satisfying dynamic constraints. The method supports velocity, acceleration, and torque constraints, and polyhedral contact friction constraints at an arbitrary number of contact points. The method is numerically stable, and empirical running time is weakly linear in the number of degrees of freedom and polynomial in the time-domain grid resolution. Experiments demonstrate that full-body motions for robots with 100 degrees of freedom and dozens of contact points are calculated in seconds.},

Aimed to create desired responses to open the door, a novel stiffness modulation method is proposed, incorporating a realtime optimization. As a preliminary experiment, a full door-opening scenario (approaching to the door and reaching, grasping, rotating and pulling the door handle) is demonstrated under a semi-autonomous operation with a pilot. The experimental result shows the effectiveness and efficacy of the proposed impedance control approach. Despite of uncertainties from sensory data, the door opening task is successfully achieved and safe and robust interaction is established without creating excessive forces.},

This framework combines multiobjective control with motion capture techniques. Each motion-tracking task is associated with a task wrench. Bounds are imposed on lower priority task wrenches to ensure the controller performance of higher priority tasks. An optimization problem is solved to compute optimal task wrenches that are based on wrench bounds. Finally, joint torques are computed using the optimal task wrenches. The novelty of our wrench-bound method is that it can handle inequality constraints on a higher priority task and maintain passivity as well. This control framework allows an operator to interact with the VH in real time, without the necessity of compromising the VH's balance. It also allows the VH to generate appropriate motions to handle interactions with the virtual environment, rather than to simply emulate captured motions. The effectiveness of our approach is demonstrated by a VH performing reaching and manipulation tasks.},

  Abstract                 = {Classical sensor-based approaches tend to constrain all the degrees of freedom of a robot during the execution of a task. In this paper, a new solution is proposed. The key idea is to divide the global full-constraining task into several subtasks, which can be applied or inactivated to take into account potential constraints of the environment. Far from any constraint, the robot moves according to the full task. When it comes closer to a configuration to avoid, a higher level controller removes one or several subtasks, and activates them again when the constraint is avoided. The last controller ensures the convergence at the global level by introducing some look-ahead capabilities when a local minimum is reached. The robot accomplishes the global task by automatically sequencing sensor-based tasks, obstacle avoidance, and short deliberative phases. In this paper, a complete solution to implement this idea is proposed, along with several experiments that prove the validity of this approach},

Remedying the limitations, the enhanced compact QP method is developed by using the practical inequality constraints with p-step-ahead predictor and time delay estimation. Through dynamic simulation results, it is verified that the enhanced compact QP method significantly improves the compact QP method in terms of efficiency and effectiveness for the real-time control of redundant manipulators under physical limits},

  Abstract                 = {Inverse dynamics controllers and operational space controllers have proved to be very efficient for compliant control of fully actuated robots such as fixed base manipulators. However legged robots such as humanoids are inherently different as they are underactuated and subject to switching external contact constraints. Recently several methods have been proposed to create inverse dynamics controllers and operational space controllers for these robots. In an attempt to compare these different approaches, we develop a general framework for inverse dynamics control and show that these methods lead to very similar controllers. We are then able to greatly simplify recent whole-body controllers based on operational space approaches using kinematic projections, bringing them closer to efficient practical implementations. We also generalize these controllers such that they can be optimal under an arbitrary quadratic cost in the commands.},

OpenSoT gives an easy way to implement tasks, constraints, bounds and solvers by providing common interfaces. We present the mathematical foundation of the library and validate it on the compliant humanoid robot COMAN to execute multiple motion tasks under a number of constraints.

The approach leverages the virtual-linkage model that provides a physical representation of the internal and CoM resultant forces with respect to reaction forces on the supporting surfaces. A grasp/contact matrix describing the complex interactions between contact forces and CoM behavior is developed. Based on this model, a new torque-based approach for the control of internal forces is suggested and illustrated on the Asimo humanoid robot. The new controller is integrated into the framework for whole-body-prioritized multitasking, thus enabling the unified control of CoM maneuvers, operational tasks, and internal-force behavior. The grasp/contact matrix is also proposed to analyze and plan internal force and CoM control policies that comply with frictional properties of the links in contact.},

Control tasks can be formulated as combinations of target positions, velocities, or forces expressed in an arbitrary number and type of coordinate frames. The proposed framework is applied to a mixed mechatronic system composed of a traditional rigid-link robot whose end-effector is a continuum (flexible) link.

On the basis of a new proximity distance computation method which ensures having continuous gradient, a new controller in the velocity domain is proposed. The gradient continuity encompasses no jump in the generated command. Included in a stack of tasks architecture, this controller has been implemented on the humanoid platform HRP-2 and experienced in a grasping task while walking and avoiding collisions with the environment and auto-collisions.},

  Abstract                 = {In this paper, we present a general approach to develop a kinematic controller for any serial robots using Programmable Multi-Axes Controller (PMAC) and MoveIt!. PMAC, a commercial product for motion control, is an all-in-one embedded system to control motion, amplify signals and acquire sensor information. MoveIt! is a state-of-the-art software for kinematics-based manipulations. It integrates many recent robotic advances, such as, Universal Robot Description File (URDF), Open Motion Planning Library (OPML) and so on. We will describe YARC (Yet Another Robot Controller), a principled way of integrating PMAC and MoveIt! together with a design of a smart control panel (TCPad). Several examples were demonstrated to show the functional superiority of this controller. The source code and hardware design have been made publicly accessible for the community.},
