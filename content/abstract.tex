In the last years, a revolution took by  storm the robotics community. Large round of investments have pushed the boundaries of applied robotics in different fields: autonomous car driving in unstructured environments as fostered by the DARPA challenge first, humanoids working in disaster scenarios through the DARPA robotics challenge (DRC), a new round of big investments by the US government and Toyota in autonomous car driving. This work documents several aspects conducted in research and engineering in the frame of the WALKMAN team and as part of the DARPA robotics challenge effort. A whole-body control library will be introduced, together with details of the whole-body software infrastucture, starting from the simulator up to the middle and high level control. Details of the robot simulator will be covered, furthermore a novel dynamic simulator for compliant underactuated hands is proposed, with results on fidelity and robustness. A report on the experimental results of the WALKMAN robot as used during the DRC finals will also be presented.
